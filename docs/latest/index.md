Metreeca/Link is a Java framework enabling rapid development of [RDFJ4](http://rdf4j.org)‑based linked data APIs and services.

Its engine leverages high‑level declarative domain models defined with [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) to automatically generate extended [LDP](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/) REST APIs supporting fine grained role‑based read/write access control, model‑driven faceted search and incoming data validation.

Published linked data resources are also made available through idiomatic REST/JSON APIs, completely shielding front‑end developers from linked data technicalities.

To get started walk through the model‑driven linked data [publishing](tutorials/linked-data-publishing/) and [interaction](tutorials/linked-data-interaction/) tutorials.

P.S. While optimized for model‑driven linked data services, the framework is also great for implementing plain REST APIs with a modular and fluent approach…
