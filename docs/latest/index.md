Metreeca/Link is an open source [RDF4J](http://rdf4j.org)-based Java framework enabling rapid development of RESTful linked data services.

Its engine automatically converts declarative high-level domain models defined with [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) into extended linked data APIs supporting faceted search, data validation and fine‑grained role‑based read/write access control rules.

Published linked data resources are made available both through [LDP](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/) and idiomatic REST/JSON APIs, supporting standardized access from third-party clients and completely shielding front‑end developers from linked data technicalities.

To get started, walk through the model‑driven linked data [publishing](tutorials/linked-data-publishing.md) and [interaction](tutorials/linked-data-interaction.md) tutorials.
