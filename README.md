# Metreeca/Link

Metreeca/Link is an open source Java framework enabling rapid model-driven development of RESTful linked data services.

Its engine automatically converts declarative high-level domain models defined with [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) into extended linked data APIs supporting faceted search, data validation and fine‑grained role‑based read/write access control rules.

Published linked data resources are made available both through [LDP](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/) and idiomatic REST/JSON APIs, supporting standardized access from third-party clients and completely shielding front‑end developers from linked data technicalities.

To get started with Metreeca/Link, open the [docs](https://metreeca.github.io/link/) and walk through the model‑driven linked data [publishing](https://metreeca.github.io/link/tutorials/publishing-ldp-apis) and [interaction](https://metreeca.github.io/link/tutorials/interacting-with-ldp-apis) tutorials.
