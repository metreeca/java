# Metreeca/Link

Metreeca/Link is a Java framework enabling rapid development of linked data applications.

Its engine leverages high-level declarative domain models defined with SHACL and SPARQL to automatically generate read/write LDP APIs supporting model-driven faceted search, data validation and fine grained role-based read/write access control.

Exposed linked data resources can also be accessed as plain REST/JSON APIs, completely shielding front-end developers from linked data technicalities.
